# CSP - Graph Coloring

The aim of this project is to implement CSP with AC3, MRV and LCV. 


# How to Run

```python main.py```

The output should look like this:

```
Found solution! Here is what I assigned to each variable (key is variable, value is color):
odict_items([(0, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 4), (9, 1), (10, 3), (11, 1), (12, 2), (13, 2), (14, 4)])
All constraints are satisfied. Congratulations!
Thanks for using me. See you next time!
